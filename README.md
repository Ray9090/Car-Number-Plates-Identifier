This is a simple vehile detection project using Computer Vision

Here I used background subtractions methods of OpenCV Library of Python and some morphological transformation for accuracy.
But this is for only static cameras. 

At the corner of the video you can see the count of the vehicles which gets recorded
when they cross a predefined limit. For the calculation of the object coordinates and object ids I defined a class called vehicles.py

Steps-Working of This System 

System will Detect Vehicle 
Localize Number plates 
Segment the Character 
Store Character in Database

Requirement to Run this Project 
Python 3.7
Open-CV 
Tkinter

Hardware Requirement for This System
Laptop
Camera

For running it, just download all files and run the main.py
Thank you.
